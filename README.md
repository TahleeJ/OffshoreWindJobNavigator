# Frontend:
to see the frontend or use it, go to ./FrontEnd/app/index.html

to edit the frontend:
- install NODE so you can use npm (https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/install)
- open the project in an IDE
- open a terminal (ctrl + shift + p in vscode then type new terminal)
- navigate to the frontend folder (run `cd ./FrontEnd`)
- run `npm install` which will create and fill a folder called "node_modules"
- run `npm start` to launch a dev version or `npm run-script build` to build the javascript file underneath the "app" folder
