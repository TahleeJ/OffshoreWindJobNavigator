# Frontend:
To edit the frontend:
- open the project in an IDE
- open a terminal (ctrl + shift + p in vscode then type new terminal)
- run `npm install` which will create and fill a folder called "node_modules"
- run `npm start` to launch a dev version
- edit the files under "./src/" which will mostly include the components from "./react components"
- only edit the .scss file and compile it to css using the 'live sass compiler" extension
